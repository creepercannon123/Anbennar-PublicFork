 flavour_themarenn.4.d:0 "Isobel I, one of the most powerful diviners of our time, is an old lady. While her contributions to the stability of the region has been invaluable, eventually she will need an heir. Having forseen the future, she is afraid that the vultures in Telgeir and Terr who fought her realm during the fourth lilac war might use this oppurtunity to usurp her realm. During his childhood, Vernell III spent years in Gabmorionn while his parents were busy fighting in the war, away from home. Under the tutulage of Lady Isobel, he made friends with other orphans that she raised and learned about Esmari traditions, literature and history. Now he is in a position to return the favour by protecting his ward's legacy.\n\nIsobel herself has expressed interest in naming one of her adopted sons as the heir, a talented young man named Arodan, one of Vernell's best friends growing up.\n\nOn the other hand, the nobles of the realm suggest Vernell himself approach Isobel and convince her that he can lead both duchies and protect her people."

 flavour_themarenn.6.t:0 "Trystan Buel And Themarennic Renaissance"
 flavour_themarenn.6.d:0 "In our efforts to promote the Esmari nobility back to their original duties, we have also encouraged patronage of arts and crafts, as well as innovative thought. Thanks to this resurgence, many an artisan or painter have been inspired to creat great works, laying under the shadow of the Lake Palace and trying to add their pieces to its great collection of arts. Meanwhile, others have had other, grander ideas.\n\nWhile raised in a merchant family in Yearncliff, Buel's talents in architecture and history were quickly recognized by the local nobility and under their patronage he was sent to Konwell and then Anbenncost to study in a veriety of fields such as history, architecture, arts, and natural sciences. And so it was that he returned after ten long years having studied and built up a reputation across the Empire, and offered his services to his patron, now the fief of Yearncliff. Under his supervision, castles and manors would be built, and the coastal infrastructure would be revamped to accomodate for more ships, fueling the everlasting rivalry between Yearncliff and Costroad. Having completed his duties to the local lord he would then present himself in front of the ducal court in Themarenn, offering to work on the Lake Palace, his life-long dream.\n\nWhile the Lake Palace has been effectively decomissioned since the fall of the Grand Duchy of Esmaria, the royal librarian informs us that he has preserved the original manuscripts about the foundations and structure of the monument, we need but to provide the funds so work could begin. In the meanwhile, some in court have suggested we hire Trystan Buel as an advisor to serve the court, while others think his time would be better spent teaching the next generation of artisians."

 flavour_themarenn.18.d:0 "Every morning at 6:30 sharp, the people of Themarenn pause to witness a spectacle that stirs their spirits—the River Marines making their solemn march through the city. With the first light of dawn casting long shadows, they move with a rhythm that speaks of unity and purpose. Clad in their ceremonial uniforms, they wear light blue coats with striking red collars, epaulets, and cuffs. Their brass buttons gleam in the morning light, and their high black boots echo on the cobblestones as they march. The sight of their distinctive red collars has become a symbol of pride for the citizens, reminding them of the bravery and tradition that the River Marines embody. Children watch with wide eyes, imagining themselves in the ranks one day, while the elders nod in respect, recalling the tales of valor that have been passed down through generations.\n\nThese Marines are more than soldiers; they are the living embodiment of Themarenn’s resilience and heroism. Their deeds in battle are the stuff of legend—from the fierce defence of Gabmorionn against the combined Telgeiri and Terrman forces to the strategic victories on the plains of Ryalanar. Each step they take is a tribute to their fallen comrades and a promise to protect the realm. As they reach the Lake Palace and take their posts, onlookers watch them in awe. They are the true sons of Drosten River-Reaver, worthy heirs to his legacy, and a constant source of inspiration and pride for every citizen of Themarenn."

 flavour_themarenn.23.d:0 "Having arrived mere minutes ago in Giberd, the royal courier ascended the platform that stood tall in the city’s central square. He unrolled a long, sealed scroll and proclaimed, "Hear ye, hear ye! Effective immediately, the coffers of the Duchy of Themarenn are open to any who dare to undertake a project of unprecedented scope: the construction of a canal between Lake Themarenn and Ryalanar. The minimum qualifications are as follows:\nOne of the following must be true:\n A letter of recommendation from a recognized contractor.\n A degree of qualification from a recognized academy.\n\nAll of the following must be true:\n Have professional supervisors who would look over the workers.\n Have studied the scope of the project and fully understand it.\nAll of the following must be true:\n  All of the following must be true:\n   One of the following must be true:\n    Has been 10 years since the degree was obtained.\n    Have the highest possible mark on your degree.\n  Be loyal to the Duchy of Themarenn and will not engage in espionage.\nGold Crowns in possession: 50\n\nOne of the following must be true:\nAll of the following must be true:\nOwn a stamp of approval from the Imperial Court.\nOwn a stamp of approval from the Emperor.\nOne of the following must be true:\nOwn at least 5 stamps of approval from the local nobility (currently 0).\nOwn a stamp of approval from the royal court.”\n\nWhile unprecedented in scope, especially for a country of our size, a direct connection to the sea has been a dream of  house sil Themarenn for as long as they have held the title to this land."
 flavour_themarenn.23.a:0 "So it begins."
 flavour_themarenn.24.t:0 "The Candidates Present Themselves"
 flavour_themarenn.24.d:0 "During the course of this past month many candidates presented themself and their portfolio to the council of ministers. Out of these very talented individuals, three in particular stand out; each with their own vision and set of specialties.\n\nThe first candidate to be approved was not an unexpected one: Lord Valen, the noble architect in the service of the count of Yearncliff has made a name for himself there, his efforts to renovate the city and attend the roads did not go unnoticed in the Capital, and now he has presented himself with a clear plan of action. He insists that the construction must be done with utmost level of co-ordination and regulatory oversight in mind, he has already prepared mountians of documents to present to all parties who would be relavant, from petty fiefs to the Emperor himself. It is clear that Lord Valen is not only a solid choice when it comes to design, but he also understands how to keep pace with the buraucratic nightmares of the Empire and its politics.\n\nAlthough not shocking, the second candidate, or rather candidates, come from the city of Ryalanar. Twin brothers Alarain and Vincen Redcoaster are famous across the dameshead for their maritime construction business; Docks, Harbours, Shipyards, Trade Depots and everything related to that area of construction is within their territory. Though inexperienced in country-spanning projects, they do offer high levels of expertise in dealing with canals, water levels, dams, and things of the sort, plus they have a veteran corps of skilled labourers to make sure the project goes smoothly.\n\nLastly, an outsider but not one from far away; A Gnomish Engineer by the name of Bobbman Netherfinger has appeared before the court, he is quite famous for his exploits in the field of artifice, but also infamous for running risky experiments. He promises to deliver a grand canal using the most modern and cutting edge devices, ones that the world has never seen before, but he also requires a generous amount of resources and crowns to work with.\n\nNow it is up to the Lord of Themarenn to choose a favourite and have them start planning for the project."

In order to stabilize the situation, then-count Vincen II allowed his fiefs to stay out of the war on the condition that they pay their taxes. But with the endless successive wars, Themarenn’s own pool of levies and funds ran short, and eventually, during the Fourth Lilac War, count Vernell II, under siege and with little hope, agreed to a humiliating deal with his own subjects, granting them nigh total freedom in turn for their involvement in the war. Now, the young and firebrand count Vernell III seeks to amend these unfair treaties, having already replaced the fief of Yeancliff with a loyalist, he looks towards the arrogant house of Sweetcastle next."

Back in the day, under the Grand Duchy of Esmaria, these noble-ministers were better known as Esmari stewards. The Stewards were to represent the best of Esmaria, be cultural ambassadors, respected diplomats, and be patrons of art and architecture. The first step to restoring their reputation is creating the infrastructure for these operations to be carried out. Namely, temples, public offices, renovation of palaces, and recruitment centers. Our capital of Themarenn is one of the most prestigious locations in the entirety of Cannor already, with clean roads, functioning services, and administrative buildings, certainly better than the unsightly and infernal-infested neighborhoods of Esmaraine!"

Alas, what is a king without a crown? Our rule over the Riverlands must be unquestionable, and if that means toppling our greedy northern neighbors, so be it!"

But radical elements within the temple could never be satisfied with generous concessions of our county and had traitorous ambitions. It is about time we showed all Ryalites that the true followers of Ryala spread words of kindness and love, not one of hate and greed, to that end, we shall grant our own clergy more power to demonstrate our moral superiority!"

Simply named ‘River’ in Dwarvish, the Elven explorers who followed the river to its origins attached ‘-aine’ to the name, and, of course, meaning ‘river’ as well. If we are to proclaim any sort of hegemony over Esmaria and become the King of The Rivers, we must assert control over the Logrodaine River and fold it into our domain!"

It was deemed appropriate to entrust his tutelage to a faithful personal friend of the royal family; Countess Isobel of Gabmorionn. In that sense did the young duke have a second mother, one which he cares for deeply. Seeing the opportunist vultures in Terr and Telgier try to take advantage of an heirless Isobel is deeply troubling to him, but if we throw our weight behind theirs, there might still be hope to stop the vultures from destroying her beloved town and terrorizing Gabmorionn."

While all gods are revered by the people, they are not equals in prayer. People of Themarenn city itself, the largest city in the country, follow Esmaryal, the mother goddess, who brings fertility to the land, a warm hearth to all homes, and watches over families, keeping them safe and prosperous. On the other hand, the majority of the rest of the country, especially in our provinces west of Themarenn, those of Ryalanar, and Sweetcaste, and Yearncliff, or further south near Konwell, revere Ryala more than other deities, the goddess of love, beauty, courtship and purity.

Was it the breathtaking beauty? The angelic grace? Or was it something more? Something none could ignore, yet could not understand.

Any wise priestess would find that question difficult to answer, not because the answer is complicated, but rather the fact that it would be hard to grasp for those not familiar with the ways of Esmaryal. Simply put, home is where one belongs to, the place where your mind can be at ease, the one place where one does not fear death, the one place where the warmth of familiarity can get you through cold, everlasting winter nights."
