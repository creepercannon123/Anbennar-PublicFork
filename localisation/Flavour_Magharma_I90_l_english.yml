 maghargma_empower_ziltaghs_clique_title:0 "Empower Ziltagh's Clique"
 maghargma_empower_ziltaghs_clique_desc:0 "The vile beast-men of the plains were only able to threaten our homes and our people due to centuries of ogrish decadence and complacency. Ziltagh has determined that to survive, all ogrekind must be dragged into the future, whether they like it or not. However, no matter how exceptional a character, this is not a task that can be completed alone; let us seek out and empower ogres of a similar mind and vision, so that we may present a united front against the forces of stagnation."

 maghargma_a_city_fit_for_giants_title:0 "A City Fit for Giants"
 maghargma_a_city_fit_for_giants_desc:0 "Ever since the cloud giant city crashed to Halann in the aftermath of the Day of Ashen Skies, the city of Maghargma has been the most powerful and grandiose in all the Ogre Valley. Now, marred by the recent centaur onslaught, and hollowed out by generations of mismanagement, it stands as a shell of its former glory. For us to reassert our rightful rule over our subjects, no expense must be spared in returning the kelaktar of kelaktars to its former glory. "

 maghargma_new_subjects_title:0 "New Subjects"
 maghargma_new_subjects_desc:0 "As we have taken a renewed focus on pressing our borders outwards and asserting our control over the plains, reports have slowly reached the capital of ten-legged creatures observing our forces from afar, darting into the depths of the Southern Peaks upon any attempts to investigate. Perhaps we have neglected what lies beneath the mountains that secure our flanks for too long. Let us build up an outpost at the mouth of the mountains so that we may learn more about these strange sightings."

 maghargma_the_little_brothers_title:0 "The Little Brothers"
 maghargma_the_little_brothers_desc:0 "Though it may have been contested at the time, the decision to open our gates to these 'goblins' has proven to be a smashing success! Their preposterously small frames and bony builds make them out to be unappetizing snacks, while their low caloric needs and sharp wits make them a welcome addition to any household looking for an extra pair of hands. By investing into these new subject of ours, we can even utilize their inborn inventiveness and seemingly unlimited numbers to bolster the ranks of our overstretched armies."

 maghargma_a_kelaktar_of_their_own_title:0 "A Kelaktar of Their Own"
 maghargma_a_kelaktar_of_their_own_desc:0 "Our goblin subjects are now an integral part of our realm. To recognize their contributions towards our great goal of rebuilding the realm of the giants, we will grant the Web Cleaners a kelaktar of their own to rule over. Not only will this shining new city present a beacon of tolerance and safety for goblins still within the Serpentspine, it will serve as a symbol of the rich rewards that can be expected from loyal servitude to the rightful rulers of Halann."

 maghargma_crush_the_westmarches_title:0 "Crush the Westmarches"
 maghargma_crush_the_westmarches_desc:0 "The Metsamic-dominant Westmarches serve as the eastern gate - and bulwark - of Yarikhoi. Its people have long fended off invasions of the centaurs, but they have yet to face our might in open battle. Should we break their armies and spirits, Yarikhoi is ours for the taking!"

 maghargma_enforce_our_claims_title:0 "Enforce Our Claims"
 maghargma_enforce_our_claims_desc:0 "We have long known of our ogre brethren over the mountains, but twin obstacles of geography and wild ogres have always kept us regrettably distant. Now, with all of the Forbidden Plains under our sway, we finally have the resources to look outwards and bring our erstwhile cousins back into the fold. "

 maghargma_sieze_the_swamps_title:0 "Seize the Swamps"
 maghargma_sieze_the_swamps_desc:0 "With the Serpent Vale now within our grasp, we must take pains to ensure that the weakling small races never again challenge our rightful claims over the region. Through the combined might and industriousness of the ogres, the land shall forever be our swamp."

 maghargma_vulshorite_brotherhood_title:0 "Vulshorite Brotherhood"
 maghargma_vulshorite_brotherhood_desc:0 "Despite our long isolation from one another, our brothers to the west have valiantly kept their souls preserved and well-provided. Unfortunately, many of them lack the nuance in their practice that we have taken such pains to cultivate. By investing into the priesthood of the region, we can make sure that this crack in our unity does not worsen into a more serious schism."

 maghargma_far_far_away_title:0 "Far Far Away"
 maghargma_far_far_away_desc:0 "Having pressed far to the west, we have finally arrived at the edge of our people's traditional lands: the swamps of Bal Mire. Despite centuries of separation, our Mossmouth subjects feel right at home walking amongst the marshy homeland of their Swamp Ogre ancestors. By investing into the already-impressive fortifications of the region, we can transform the region into a formidable anchor point for our western empire, and sponsor the triumphant return of the land's rightful owners. "

 maghargma_the_carrot_title:0 "The Carrot..."
 maghargma_the_carrot_desc:0 "While our lands burned and our people starved at the hands of the centaur invaders, our so-called 'subjects' simply cowered behind the walls of their kelaktars and waited for us to solve the issue for them. Ghornma may have let such insolence go unpunished, but Ziltagh is not his father. Let us lure the useless Ojkagmas to the capital with a great feast 'honoring their fortitude' where they will soon find themselves - and their realms - at the mercy of the Mengotsa."

 maghargma_subdue_the_north_title:0 "Subdue the North"
 maghargma_subdue_the_north_desc:0 "Outside of our shared blood and faith, the wild ogres of the north could not be more different from the civilized ogres that Maghargma presides over. They delight in their backwardness, and would sooner burn the world down than attempt to seize their rightful dominion over it. With the ogre valley united behind us, it is time to finally put these subordinate pests back in their rightful place."

 maghargma_mass_conscription_title:0 "Mass Conscription"
 maghargma_mass_conscription_desc:0 "Once again, our goblin subjects have proven themselves to be an invaluable component in our growing empire. For the same resource cost it would take to equip a single ogre for battle, we can field an entire company of goblin soldiers. With our ogrish population already straining to fill the ranks of our vast armies, the time may be right to follow in the footsteps of our ancestors and let our subjects do our fighting for us."

 maghargma_harness_the_heartlands_title:0 "Harness the Heartlands"
 maghargma_harness_the_heartlands_desc:0 "The Heartlands are the beating heart of Yarikhoi, though undeveloped and sparsely populated, the vast agricultural wealth of the region is what allows the crescent of cities to support the population that it does. With this region under our control, our armies will be able to feast to their stomachs' content as we continue our final push to reclaim our creators' legacy."

 maghargma_trouble_with_trolls_title:0 "Trouble with Trolls"
 maghargma_trouble_with_trolls_desc:0 "Despite our place as the legitimate heirs of our collective creators, the trolls of the northern pass hold a bizarre grudge against us for our righteous consumption of our gods. Regardless of its irrationality, the bad blood between us has made administrating our trollish cousins much more difficult than we had originally anticipated. These cousins of ours must not be allowed to impede our reclamation of our rightful lands, the only question is how they will be made to stand aside."

 maghargma_dynamic_mission_trolls_title:0 "Dynamic Mission"
 maghargma_dynamic_mission_trolls_desc:0 " "

 maghargma_greater_than_giants_title:0 "Greater than Giants"
 maghargma_greater_than_giants_desc:0 "Despite all their power, the giants were never able to crack the mountainous defenses of the dwarven empire of old. They were also unable to stop themselves from being eaten. As their not-extinct successors, we will not only reach the same hights our creators once reached, but surpass them. What better way to prove our ascendancy than to seize the crown jewel of their ancient enemies for ourselves?"

 maghargma_land_of_frost_title:0 "Land of Frost"
 maghargma_land_of_frost_desc:0 "Now that the Northern Pass is  secure, and our flanks against the powers of the Dwarovar have been bolstered, nothing stands between us and the lands of the Frost Giants. Where Jormir and Kranmas failed, we will succeed; the human and orc squatters will be swept away in a tide of ogrish might, and the rightful rule of the giants shall finally return to the frozen west."

 maghargma_lords_of_frost_title:0 "Lords of Frost"
 maghargma_lords_of_frost_desc:0 "We have finally swallowed the lands of the ancient Frost Giants into our growing dominion. Our western claims may be secured, but the work is not uet done. Let us bend the earth itself to our whims, and set alight the forges of the north so that our armies may be equipped with the strongest of steel and most destructive of weapons."

 maghargma_brothers_in_arms_title:0 "Brother In Arms"
 maghargma_brothers_in_arms_desc:0 "Though we may have drifted apart in the past millennia, the Trolls are still our distant kin. Even if they are not ensouled with the same spirit which we ogres took from our giant creators, mastery over the trolls is just as part of our inheritance as our temporal claims. Surely the trolls know in their blood that their purpose is to fight on behalf of their creators. By throwing our industrial might and skill in building behind them, we can fully mobilize our troll populace for war, and in doing so, grant them the purpose that they have been craving for thousands of years."

 maghargma_a_new_kind_of_livestock_title:0 "A New Kind Of Livestock"
 maghargma_a_new_kind_of_livestock_desc:0 "Inadvertent or not, our giant creators have bestowed upon us a great many gifts from beyond the grave; perhaps their souls still shape reality for the benefit of their new hosts. Regardless, it seems as if troll biology is yet another of these hidden boons. The problem with normal livestock is that you can only harvest meat once, but what if that weren't the case? With the trolls, an ogre's most fantastical dream can become a reality: an unending supply of regenerating meat."

 maghargma_strike_back_title:0 "Strike Back"
 maghargma_strike_back_desc:0 "Only through the exceptional leadership of Ziltagh were the Fathide Ogres spared from a Hunger-fueled extinction at the hands of the centaur invaders. For the crime of despoiling our lands, and for the regicide of the late Ghornma Gravelhide, we will force the centaurs to atone with their gold, land, and flesh."

 maghargma_settle_succession_title:0 "Settle Succession"
 maghargma_settle_succession_desc:0 "While Ziltagh himself is an ogre of once-in-a-millenia political and military acumen, his son Chike is quite the opposite. Taking more after his decadent grandfather than his father, the Ogre Valley has languished under his oversight while Ziltagh is out on campaign. If we wish for Ziltagh's reforms to take root, something must be done to prevent a backslide after his passing."

 maghargma_reforge_the_iron_chain_title:0 "Reforge the Iron Chain"
 maghargma_reforge_the_iron_chain_desc:0 "At the high points of ogrish influence over the Forbidden Plains, the so-called Iron Chain was an economic artery, facilitating the flow of wealth from beyond our valley directly into our coffers. Using centaur intermediaries, the high-quality iron of Olkhalebuhr would be ferried to the minerally-poor humans of Yarikhoi for great profits. In order for us to reach the heights of power we once enjoyed, our mercantile ties to the crescent of cities must be secured."

 maghargma_a_friendly_face_title:0 "A Friendly Face"
 maghargma_a_friendly_face_desc:0 "Whether they know it or not, the squabbling Triunics squat atop the crowning jewel of our Fire Giant creators, depriving us the most choice cut of our inheritance. Unfortunately, the centaurs' recent temper tantrum shocked them out of their bickering into closing ranks. If we are to find any cracks within their facade of unity, we must first present ourselves as civilized equals above the barbarism of our common foes. To even entertain the thought of equality with such small-souled beings may be an upaletteable debasement, but the rewards it promises are delicious indeed."

 maghargma_shatter_the_mirror_title:0 "Shatter the Mirror"
 maghargma_shatter_the_mirror_desc:0 "However much it may pain us, every well balanced meal will always contain a dish or two that must be suffered through. Now, it is about time to be done suffering through the gruel of diplomacy, and to move on to the meat of war. We must marshall our forces in preparation of our opening blow against the weaklings of the Federation, so that we may finally make our inheritance whole."

 maghargma_jewel_of_the_fire_giants_title:0 "The Jewel of the Fire Giants"
 maghargma_jewel_of_the_fire_giants_desc:0 "The ogres of the Forbidden Plains now stand on the precipice of greatness. Our forces are mobilized in numbers never seen in our history since perhaps the days of the revolt against the gods, and all of ogrish society is united behind the unassailable will of the Mengotsa. However, the wisest ogres know that the greatest meals should not be swallowed whole, but savored; let us establish a beachhead against the human squatters from which we may consume this greatest of meals, bite by bite."

 maghargma_lords_of_fire_title:0 "Lords of Fire"
 maghargma_lords_of_fire_desc:0 "A new day is dawning upon the heirs of the Fire Giants. For the first time in over eight millenia, the realm of our creators is united under a single power. Once every last city and fortress in the plains is waving the flag of Maghargma, none will doubt our claim as the true heirs of the Fire Giants."

 maghargma_the_southern_expedition_title:0 "The Southern Expedition"
 maghargma_the_southern_expedition_desc:0 "In our quest to unite all the lands of the giantkin under our rule, we must remain ever vigilant. In this regard, our knowledge of our southern neighbors is pitiful, consisting of a mere collection of stories gathered from merchants traveling up and down the Serpent Gift. Let us acquaint ourselves with the nations beyond the passes so that we might know if the kingdoms of the south are friends or foes."

 maghargma_a_new_invasion_title:0 "A New Invasion"
 maghargma_a_new_invasion_desc:0 "Along with the delightful discovery that our brethren once terrorized the ancient humans of Bulwar, our intelligence-gathering has also unearthed tales of a great centaur invasion of the lands to our south. As proud followers of tradition, we see no reason that such an occurrence should not happen again. With the cooperation of our centaur subjects, the fertile river valleys and expansive deserts will once again be a homeland for the beast-men."

 maghargma_legions_of_bronze_title:0 "Legions of Bronze"
 maghargma_legions_of_bronze_desc:0 "As we have conquered further into Bulwar in search for any clues that can lead us to the cultural remains of our long-lost brethren, we have stumbled across a stunning number of intricately-detailed bronze statues of ogres. Though it is no surprise that anyone would wish to render our goldy visages in loving detail, the statues date to a time long after the Djinnbound ogres would have stalked the southern lands. To satiate our knowledge, we should ensure that we have as many samples as possible within our lands, and commission a magical study on the sculptures to see if there is something more to be discovered."

 maghargma_loyaltys_reward_title:0 "Loyalty's Reward"
 maghargma_loyaltys_reward_desc:0 "Our goblin subjects have stood loyally by our sides for generations, sharing in all of our greatest victories and bitterest setbacks in our quest to reclaim our lands. Now that we hold the great dwarven capital of Amldhir, it is about time that they reap their just rewards. Naturally, our oldest and closest subjects, the Web Cleaners, are the perfect candidates for the job. Not only are their small frames much better suited for the claustrophobic confines of the dwarovar, their beloved spiders will flourish within the deep dark of the caverns. Though we will be sad to see many of them go, every ogre will know that feasting fit for ogres awaits any who pass through King's Rock."

 maghargma_western_breadbasket_title:0 "The Western Breadbasket"
 maghargma_western_breadbasket_desc:0 "As Fathide administrators took stock of the resources available within the newly-reunited Serpent Vale, the ancient irrigation network left behind by the dwarves has sparked a particular interest for our priests back in the Ogre Valley. What was once thought to be an unproductive swamp, cursed to remain a backwater, could instead be harnessed to provide sustenance for countless ogres! We must make all haste to realize this dream, our Hunger demands it."

 maghargma_family_reunion_title:0 "Family Reunion"
 maghargma_family_reunion_desc:0 "Our greatest dreams have finally been achieved, and all ogrekind is now united under a single banner. No longer a title of ambition, but a statement of fact, the Mengotsa truly can be called the Lord of All Ogres. To celebrate such a momentous occasion, we shall throw the greatest feast that the world has ever known, featuring foods and flavors from around the planet, not even the giants would have known bliss like this. For the triumphant Mengotsa themselves, a meal of particular renown has been prepared, perhaps the most important meal in all history."

 maghargma_the_rarest_cut_title:0 "The Rarest Cut"
 maghargma_the_rarest_cut_desc:0 "This mission will be revisited once the §YNomsyulhan Gateway§! is in"

 maghargma_the_fleet_of_unity_title:0 "The Fleet Of Unity"
 maghargma_the_fleet_of_unity_desc:0 "This mission will be revisited once §YInsyaa§! is in"

 maghargma_lords_of_the_cloud_title:0 "Lords Of The Cloud"
 maghargma_lords_of_the_cloud_desc:0 "This mission will be revisited once §YInsyaa§! is in"

 maghargma_beasts_of_burden_title:0 "Beasts of Burden"
 maghargma_beasts_of_burden_desc:0 "However much we may wish to wipe the centaur menace from the plains, we do not have the capacity to both consolidate our authority at home and waste resources on building costly new kelaktars deep into the steppes. First, we must break the will of these upstart beast-men and show them that none can hope to resist the wrath of the ogres. Then, we will earn their loyalty by allowing them the privilege of returning to us in chains, rather than on dinnerplates."

 maghargma_reorganize_the_horsemen_title:0 "Reorganize the Horsemen"
 maghargma_reorganize_the_horsemen_desc:0 "With our old tributaries securely back under our control, any attempts to actually administrate them have been met with frustration. Their mercurial allegiances and inability to keep still for an extended period of time has made the act of collecting taxes and levees more like bounty hunting than bookkeeping. We should appoint a single Caehn to manage our holdings for us, so that we may direct our efforts towards our further conquests."

 maghargma_lord_of_the_plains_title:0 "Lord of the Plains"
 maghargma_lord_of_the_plains_desc:0 "Even at the height of ogre power, our web of influence never stretched much further than the near shore of the Serpent Gift river; but now, we are faced with a wholly unique opportunity to extend our grasp over the whole of the Forbidden Plains. Much like a skilled war sprinter, we must make full use of our momentum and push on to the very edges of the steppes, not stopping until every last centaur clan is placed under our yoke."

 maghargma_ordering_the_steppes_title:0 "Ordering the Steppes"
 maghargma_ordering_the_steppes_desc:0 "Once again, we have found ourselves at the limit of what our nation can effectively administer when dealing with the chaotic centaur polities beneath us. These are our rightful lands, and this meaningless factionalism will be put to a stop. Under our watchful aegis, order and comprehensibility will once again rule over the plains, for the first time since our masters bent the land to their will. Political boundaries and tribute agreements will be formalized, migratory patterns recorded, and succession will be entirely dictated by our whims. With these reforms, we can not only expect for an administrative burden to be lifted, but a great deal of wealth to begin flowing into the capital as tribute becomes more regular."

 maghargma_the_eastern_edge_title:0 "The Eastern Edge"
 maghargma_the_eastern_edge_desc:0 "After so many have died for what amounts to a sea of dry, empty, grassland, our sacrifices have finally begun to pay off. The fertile lands of Nuzurbokh are now within our reach, as well as the vast mineral resources that lie below. As we have spread our grasp over our rightful dominion, our industry has been strained to its limit to keep our forces well-fed and equipped. Like a Hunger-stricken ogre, we must waste no time in tearing open the bowels of the Halann to feast upon the sweet mineral sustenance that our forges cry out for. Meaningless concepts like "worker safety" or "sustainability" have no place here, we must consume as much as we can, as fast as we can, all for the strength of the realm."

 maghargma_pacify_the_brightmarch_title:0 "Pacify the Brightmarch"
 maghargma_pacify_the_brightmarch_desc:0 "To any would-be conqueror that surveys Yarikhoi, the most delectable morsel in their eyes would be the Brightmarch. Both the most populous region of the crescent of cities, and the richest industrially, securing control over the region will be a massive boon for our growing empire. Used to constant warring among themselves and outsiders alike, the humans who currently live there will be no small challenge to overcome, but they have never faced the likes of an army of ogres backed by the promise of the greatest feast in a generation upon their victory. Crush them, and the morale of the remaining Triunics will crumble like the feeble walls they foolishly believe will slow our inevitable conquest."

 maghargma_a_proper_celebration_title:0 "A Proper Celebration"
 maghargma_a_proper_celebration_desc:0 "For far too long our misguided Soulseeker brothers have languished under regimes completely apathetic to the quality of food that they have access to. Their so-called "feasts" pale in comparison to what the average Fathide has come to expect for a midday snack, not to mention their abysmal lack of flavoring! Let us show these starving ogres what a real party looks like, and see if they don't leave their meager old ways behind."

 maghargma_confront_the_ancestors_title:0 "Confront the Ancestors"
 maghargma_confront_the_ancestors_desc:0 "We have had our own share of troubles breaking free of antiquated practices and striding towards a mightier future, so imagine our shock when we discovered that the Soulseekers are so stuck in their ways that they do everything in their power to not let the past die! This unnatural process of maintaining ancestor spirits is not only a drain on resources, hardly anything gets done when each and every action is scrutinized by a dozen generations of argumentative ancestors. If we are to hope for any kind of future together, these ancestors must be shown their proper place, one way or another."

 maghargma_dynamic_mission_soulseekers_title:0 "Dynamic Mission"
 maghargma_dynamic_mission_soulseekers_desc:0 " "

 maghargma_lords_of_stone_title:0 "Lords of Stone"
 maghargma_lords_of_stone_desc:0 "Our ancient creators were the true masters of the material plane; what they willed would be done, not through some ephemeral genie magic, but through the might of labor and industry. As inheritors of this will, we too are the rightful stewards of all things material, an inheritance that this "Hokuma" threatens to undermine! With the help of our Horned brothers, we shall be rid of this renegade spirit in true ogre fashion. A being of oh-so great power and stature is certainly deserving of a feast in their honor, for which they will be our most central guest. If nothing else, the taste of Great Spirit energy will undoubtedly be refreshingly novel."

 maghargma_share_the_burden_title:0 "Ancient Wisdom"
 maghargma_share_the_burden_desc:0 "Like us, the Soulseekers have survived the twin perils of starvation and tenacious external enemies, and only been made stronger for it. While we kept our gazes fixed forwards to give us the strength to strive for a better future, our brothers drew upon their past, taking inspiration from their past triumphs to inspire themselves to keep on surviving. If their spirit-bound ancestors are the manifestation of generations of ogrish strength, who are we to deny them their symbols? By working alongside the ancestor spirits, we can forge an alloy of ogrish might that transcends time, fusing the skills of the past and the industry of the future into creations of unprecedented power."

 maghargma_clean_up_their_mess_title:0 "Clean Up Their Mess"
 maghargma_clean_up_their_mess_desc:0 "As far back as our history stretches, the ogres of Maghargma have always defined ourselves against our pasts. We were not content as slaves, so we slew and ate our masters. We were not content to be disunited, so we united our people. We were not content in allowing our faith to be a byword for barbarism, so we reformed it. The past has only ever held ogres back, and the ancestor spirits only serve to hold us back. They shall not be allowed to persist, and we will use all the resources at our disposal to be rid of them."

 maghargma_whispers_from_afar_title:0 "Whispers From Afar"
 maghargma_whispers_from_afar_desc:0 ""

 maghargma_sieze_the_serpent_title:0 "Seize the Serpent"
 maghargma_sieze_the_serpent_desc:0 "Looking out upon the vast expanse of flatland that stretches out beyond our eastern border, few would think that anything of value could be found away from the comfortable civilization of their homeland. However, travel far enough, and you will eventually come to a land overripe with untapped potential. Far from any human or ogre settlement, the fertile banks of the upper Serpent Gift enrich both the soil and its occupants. Though there may be some centaurs currently occupying the region, what do they know about agriculture? It is only sensible that we assume control of the river ourselves, so that the wealth of the Gift can realize its full potential."

 maghargma_consolidate_the_riverlands_title:0 "Consolidate the Riverlands"
 maghargma_consolidate_the_riverlands_desc:0 "As we work towards our goal of extracting the true worth of the Serpent Gift, having to cooperate with any number of diverse centaur clans in order to get anything done has been the opposite of productive. By centralizing these realms and their wealth under a single ruler, we should be able to streamline agricultural cultivation and resource extraction, while allowing our diplomats to focus on more essential matters than tribal disputes over grazing land."

 maghargma_introduce_cash_crops_title:0 "Introduce Cash Crops"
 maghargma_introduce_cash_crops_desc:0 "Although it would be a simple matter to allow the centaur clans of the steppe to continue their pastoralism without interference, the influx of new crops and ideas into Maghargman society from the wider world has presented us with a far more enticing future for our domain. Under the guidance of our top architects, we can construct great irrigation networks up and down the length of the mighty Serpent Gift river. With each swathe of arable land created, another opportunity for immense profits will fall right onto our plates, the possibilities of what to grow are seemingly limitless! Just as our Fire Giant creators turned these lands into a paradise of their own making, so too shall we make a garden of these desolate steppes."

 maghargma_control_the_amberlands_title:0 "Control the Amberlands"
 maghargma_control_the_amberlands_desc:0 "To the far north of Yarikhoi lie the Amberlands, home to some of the oldest settlements on the crescent. Though battered by freezing polar winters each year, the Amberlands are a shining beacon of mercantile wealth, fueled in large part by the vast quantities of gold that lie beneath the isle of Ultakal and the immense profits brought back by the Treasure Fleet each decade. Not only will the conquest of this region cut off the largest source of gold and iron for the rest of Yarikhoi, but will connect our people with the wider world in ways we never could have imagined. With the Amberlands fixed in our maws, all of Haless will be just one bite away."

 maghargma_the_second_ogre_valley_title:0 "The Second Ogre Valley"
 maghargma_the_second_ogre_valley_desc:0 "For a millennia and a half, an entire parallel ogre civilization has been flourishing on the far side of the plains, completely unbeknownst to us. The discovery has energized our people, and public support is at an all-time high. If the title of Mengotsa is to hold any legitimacy, then we must do everything in our power to ensure that these long-lost brothers of ours are incorporated into our growing realm. By our might alone, all ogres will be reunited under the banner of a true giantkin state!"

 maghargma_back_into_the_fold_title:0 "Back into the Fold"
 maghargma_back_into_the_fold_desc:0 "With Nomsyulhan fully under our control, it is time to redress some past crimes against our ogre brethren. Despite the charity they were shown when allowed to first settle in the region, they perniciously pushed the Soulseekers out of the most fertile lands in the valley, leaving only the most dangerous and desolate lands open for ogre settlement; the fact that the Soulseekers have held on for so long is a testament to ogre tenacity and hardiness. Now that we are back in charge, whether we punish or forgive the Hobgoblins is up to us, either way they shall know that they continue to live only through our beneficence."

 maghargma_tame_the_wastes_title:0 "Tame the Wastes"
 maghargma_tame_the_wastes_desc:0 "What is most curious about the human residents of Gozengun is their seeming fear of the very land itself. Either holing themselves up in cities to avoid the wrath of the spirits, or centring their society around catering to their needs, it all seems pathetic in our eyes. Our masters shaped this very land themselves, and these spirits are mere maggots feasting on an overripe crop. As our birthright, these lands are ours to do with what we will, and no stomachless being can tell us otherwise."

 maghargma_lords_of_the_hills_title:0 "Lords of the Hills"
 maghargma_lords_of_the_hills_desc:0 "To fully wrest control of north Haless away from the perfidious spirits, we must turn to the ancient knowledge our creators entrusted with our Soulseeker brothers: the art of spirit binding. By building up facilities for the express purpose of sealing away spirits, we can take strides towards suppressing the most bothersome of our ephemeral adversaries. Not only is our plan totally unique in design, its construction is flawless and eternal; if the spirits have a problem with being bound, it's not like they'll ever be able to break free and do anything about it."

 maghargma_the_third_realm_title:0 "The Third Realm"
 maghargma_the_third_realm_desc:0 "Though we have long heard tales of creatures similar in stature and demeanor to us from whispers carried along the treasure fleet, only now have we been able to confirm our suspicions. Another branch of our wide giantkin family yet lives, nestled into the heart of Haless. As seems to be true of all ogres, these "oni" have also made their home among hills and valleys, and are likewise beset on all sides by terrible foes. It is our sworn duty as Mengotsa to come to the aid of our brothers in their time of need, and deliver them the security that can only be achieved through unity."

The King resided within his palace, gorging himself of feasts gathered from Centaur tributes while his warlord vassals ruled their lands unapposed, paying little more than lip service to their liege. When the Centaurs attacked the kingdom suddenly and the king fell in battle, the mighty Ziltagh rose to the throne, leading our people to victory and reaffirming the power of Maghargma over the warlords.

With a voice that sounded like two rocks being ground together, the figure on Zako's right exchanged some words with the hulking figure that sat on the throne before him, before motioning to a leaner blue-skinned giant waiting in the wings. The blue ogre, evidently a mage, slowly began to circle around Zako, sketching strange glowing shapes on the ground with the tip of his staff. Before Zako was able to process what was happening, the voice that boomed at him in his own language from the throne stunned him into instant focus. \n\n "Speak" \n\n Taking a gulp of air, Zako proceeded to tell the same tale he told the garrison commander he had first encountered while leading his people out into the light. Things were changing in the deep, and his clan was forced to choose between eking out a meager existence in the familiar dark, or taking a gamble on a new lease on life in the light. It had taken a great deal of persuasion and threatening, but the clan ultimately decided the latter, packing up all the belongings they could muster on their pack spiders, and heading east as far as their legs would carry them. Falling to his knees, he pleaded the kingly figure before him to accept the Web Cleaners into his realm, in exchange for eternal servitude and gifts of all they possessed. After a moment of silence that went on for what felt like ages, the seated figure motioned to their mage once again, who dispelled the translation magic with a snap of their fingers. Though he could not understand the words, Zako could only watch on in horror as the room devolved into the sounds of what could only be understood to be an argument. \n\n "My lord, surely we do not have the food to spare for such pathetic creatures. Just look at them, they don't even have any meat on them" \n "Need I remind you who the ruler is here? I believe these creatures will make for fine slaves, and that is final. All of the Web Cleaner tribe are henceforth the personal property of the Mengotsa, and shall be allowed to enter the valley unmolested.""
