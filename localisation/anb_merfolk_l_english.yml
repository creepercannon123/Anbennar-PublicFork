 merfolk_events.13.c:0 "That explains a lot"
 merfolk_events.14.t:0 "Beachfront Protests"
 merfolk_events.14.d:0 "The waterways in [merfolk_settlement.GetName] have always been bustling with activity, yet bubbling displeasure has recently joined the energetic waves. Merfolk, breaching the surface in organized groups, have begun impeding vessels, jeering passerby, and vandalizing ocean-side buildings with slogans such as 'fin or feet, where we greet, all should meet.'\n\nDespite their disparate methods, their impact is the same: our activity in the area thoughtlessly disrupts and impedes those beneath the waves. The merfolk point to the damaged flora and fauna of their home, a lack of water-accessible buildings for their merchants and visitors, and tumultuous currents caused by unending ship traffic.\n\nOn the one hand, we can reconsider how we live along the shore and share the waters with our aquatic neighbors, earning their trust. On the other hand, who do they think they are, telling us what to do?! How should we respond to these beachfront protests?"
 merfolk_events.14.a:0 "Acquiesce for the good of our merfolk neighbors"
 merfolk_events.14.b:0 "Pah! Do they own the surface too?"
 merfolk_events.15.t:0 "Returned Flotsam"
 merfolk_events.15.d:0 "'Oh pearlescent [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], caretaker of $COUNTRY$, please accept this bounty dredged from within our domain. We claim all sunken goods by right of the endless blue, but given our peoples' accord, we have only claimed the lionfish's share to compensate for the damages caused by the refuse, both material and mental. From the remaining portion, we return these trinkets and goods to you, our surface allies.'\n\nSmiling softly, the merfolk envoy bows from his magical water bowl, gesturing to his flank as guards ferry in waterlogged loot. Bit by bit, the hoard stacks high until it forms a mound within the capital hall.\n\nEven during a calm year, $COUNTRY$ still loses untold quantities of cargo and ships to storms, war, and other misfortunes, but like a caring neighbor, the merfolk have returned a sizable portion of that lost wealth. Considering  [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] response, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] thinks swiftly: accepting the gesture would be a welcome bounty to the nation's coffers, but refusing it as the merfolk's right would also endear the sea peoples to $COUNTRY$. Of course, demanding all the treasure be returned is also a viable option, but what value is gold compared to trust?"
 merfolk_events.15.a:0 "Thank you for returning our lost goods"
 merfolk_events.15.b:0 "Please take it all as compensation for littering in your domain"
 merfolk_events.15.c:0 "If it's ours, we demand ecery bit back from the briny depths!"
 merfolk_events.16.t:0 "Youth Stranding"
 merfolk_events.16.d:0 "A fisher screams from her beach hut window, berating a trio of snickering kids lying on her sun drying tarps. An annoyed city cook dumps a bucket of water over a dehydrated teen reeling from their failed climb up to the restaurant's roof. A local guard, carrying his fifth trespasser back to the local estuary, dreads his captain's inevitable dress down for not completing his daily patrols.\n\nAs relations have strengthened between $COUNTRY$ and the local sea peoples, rambunctious merfolk youths have begun testing that trust. Playing a game called “land reefing,” impressionable players compete by dragging themselves ashore and relaxing in humorous spots: the further inland and more precarious, the funnier. Often drained from their antics, these teens rely on charitable locals to drag them back to the water's safety.\n\nTired of this new craze, our citizens gripe about the constant disturbances and rescue efforts, demanding we discipline these piscine daredevils. As a silver lining, the merfolk's parents, otherwise fearful of the surface world, extol our people for ensuring their children don't meet a dry and deadly end. What should we do about these mischief makers?"
 merfolk_events.16.a:0 "It's all in good fun"
 merfolk_events.16.b:0 "No more fun and games!"
 merfolk_events.17.t:0 "Childish Curiosity"
 merfolk_events.17.d:0 "News have reached us of a curious child interacting with a merfolk child. As far as we are aware the merfolk is aware as well and not intervening (yet). Should we use this potential opening to improve relations?"
 merfolk_events.17.a:0 "Let's try it!"
 merfolk_events.17.b:0 "Put in some effort!"
 merfolk_events.18.t:0 "Changing Tides: A Flood Approaching"
 merfolk_events.18.d:0 "The settlement in front of our city is in somewhat of a turmoil. The governments anti-surface question is being questioned, but without our help the movement will surely die out quickly."
 merfolk_events.18.a:0 "Uninteresting"
 merfolk_events.18.b:0 "Let's support the Pro-Surface Movement"
 merfolk_events.19.t:0 "Changing Tides: An Ebb"
 merfolk_events.19.d:0 "The settlement in front of our city is in somewhat of a turmoil. A change of leadership is probable, anti-surface radicals planted the seed of doubt in the merfolk relations to us."
 merfolk_events.19.a:0 "Don't intervene"
 merfolk_events.19.b:0 "Let's reassure them in our relations"
 merfolk_events.20.t:0 "Witch-King under the Sun"
 merfolk_events.20.d:0 "Rumours have been circulating that there is... Something going on in the usually pretty divided merfolk settlements on the east coast. One of the Mage led Autocracies started taking over other settlements and consolidating power in the area. Travelers from lands far away see similarities to the Witch-Kings of the past. If unchecked, the situation could get out of control."
 merfolk_events.20.a:0 "the sea will calm itself eventually"
 merfolk_events.20.b:0 "Maybe we can make arrangements"
 merfolk_events.20.c:0 "Help the resistance!"
 merfolk_events.21.t:0 "A Calm Sea"
 merfolk_events.21.d:0 "News reaches us that the Witch-King was slain in a last stand by a united front of multiple settlements that banded together to withstand him. Due to their differences this unlikely alliance doesn't last long, though, right after the deciding battle petty rivalries arose again."
 merfolk_events.21.a:0 "Good for us?"
 merfolk_events.22.t:0 "A Demanding Sea"
 merfolk_events.22.d:0 "The Witch-King won. He consolidated the surrounding settlements into one quite powerful Mage Kingdom. He even demands tribute from us, or else he will make the life of our coastal citizens miserable."
 merfolk_events.22.a:0 "Sigh... Pay up"
 merfolk_events.22.b:0 "Refuse!"
 merfolk_events.23.t:0 "Arrangements: A Success"
 merfolk_events.23.d:0 "After winning the short War of Consolitation, the Witch-King has reacted favourably upon our gifts from two years ago. He is willing to reciprocate the gesture and promises that our fishers and scavengers on the beaches will be quite lucky in the coming years"
 merfolk_events.23.a:0 "Great news for us"
 merfolk_events.24.t:0 "Fighting is Expensive"
 merfolk_events.24.d:0 "The war isn't going well for the coalition. They ask us for more resources to fight"
 merfolk_events.24.a:0 "Everything for victory!"
 merfolk_events.24.b:0 "We just don't have the resources"
 merfolk_events.25.t:0 "Fighting Requires Luck"
 merfolk_events.25.d:0 "A lucky strike! The Witchking was killed by a lucky spell cast by one of our Merfolk allies. The coalition is relieved and thanks us profusely and gifts us the remaining war chest"
 merfolk_events.25.a:0 "Clear Seas!"
 merfolk_events.26.t:0 "A Witch-King's Wrath"
 merfolk_events.26.d:0 "Our actions angered the Witchking. He starts casting spell after spell damaging the coastal settlements."
 merfolk_events.26.a:0 "Ashen Skies!"
 merfolk_events.27.t:0 "Death of a King, Wrath of a People"
 merfolk_events.27.d:0 "After over a decade or reign the Witchking is dead. His nation quickly fractured into its former state of many individual settlements. And the sea remembers. The merfolk remembers our involvement in the Witchking rising to power and they hate us for it."
 merfolk_events.27.a:0 "Oops..."
 merfolk_events.28.t:0 "Undertow Raiders"
 merfolk_events.28.d:0 "'My [Root.Monarch.GetTitle],'' a bruised soldier hobbles into the capital, 'I bring dire news from [merfolk_unfriendly_province.GetName].'\n\nWincing from her wounds, the soldier unrolls page after page of reports and orders from the province: warehouse raids, dock fires, ship attacks, and mounting casualties.\n\n'It's the merfolk, my [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. We've always hated their ilk, but one of their blasted ocean nations just set their sights on [merfolk_unfriendly_province.GetName].'\n\nThe soldier swallows hard, lost amid fresh battle memories.\n\n'They outnumber our forces, pierce our defenses, and strike without reprisal; It's untenable given current resources. My commander sent me to request additional support to combat the fishy bastards.'\n\nShould we act swiftly and harshly, we can easily repel these attacks, but such overwhelming force requires valuable resources perhaps better spent elsewhere. What should we do?"
 merfolk_events.28.a:0 "Bolster the garrison"
 merfolk_events.28.b:0 "We have more pressing matters"
 merfolk_events.28.c:0 "Get to the bottom of this issue"
 merfolk_events.29.t:0 "Undertow Comrades"
 merfolk_events.29.d:0 "“My [Root.Monarch.GetTitle],” a cheery soldier strides into the capital,\n\n'I bring terrific news from [merfolk_friendly_province.GetName].'\n\nSore from her previous night of merriment, the soldier unrolls page after page of reports and orders from the province: warehouse thefts thwarted, dock fires extinguished, ship repair support, and rescued drowning victims.\n\n'It's the merfolk, my [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. We've always liked their ilk, but one of their blessed ocean nations just set their sights on [merfolk_friendly_province.GetName].'\n\nThe soldier swallows hard, still fighting a stuffed, carefree stomach.\n\n'They assist our forces, bolster our defenses, and help without request; It's honestly making our posts a bit boring. My commander sent me to request formal acceptance of our fishy friends' efforts.'\n\nShould we accept the merfolk's support, we are sure to recoup costs we would have otherwise spent on the province, but such thankless gratitude does not justly honor the merfolk's charity. Instead, we could sanction their positions, paying them and ensuring the province's prosperity for generations to come. What should we do?"
 merfolk_events.29.a:0 "Welcome the support!"
 merfolk_events.29.b:0 "Authorize their supportive role"
 merfolk_events.29.c:0 "Take advantage of these sea simpletons"
 merfolk_events.30.t:0 "Seaside Serenades"
 merfolk_events.30.d:0 "From a smoke-choked watering hole in [merfolk_abduction.GetName], a tattooed sailor, eyes sunken with fatigue from weeks at sea, drinks merrily amid his fellow mariners.\n\n“Aye, I witnessed it all with my own eyes and ears. A thousand days I've sailed past that spot, its rocky walls high as a fortress - a smuggler's den if I''ve ever laid eyes on one! But never has the shore wept with such melodious meters, aching of desire and sorrow, confusion and wonder. Amid the moonless waves, a flicker of firelight radiated above the rocks like a dying forge. I drifted right past that inland cove, but alas, by fate or caution, whatever was making those sea sights vanished: only a burning fire left on the shore remained.”\n\nAt first a tall tale, the sailor's story soon proved true. For the last few weeks, other travelers along [merfolk_abduction.GetName]'s shoreline have told similar accounts about the inlet's nighttime activities: strange crooning, warming fires, but an otherwise empty shore. As dread swells among the locals about nefarious powers at work, a local guard captain swears to get to the bottom of it."
 merfolk_events.30.a:0 "What a strange thing"
 merfolk_events.31.t:0 "Ocean Abduction!"
 merfolk_events.31.d:0 "Storm clouds roll overhead, darkening the peerless sky in ominous gray. Centerstage, the local guard captain stands upright, his brow thick with nervous sweat and hand wrapped in soiled bandages. A general, fresh from the capital, sups on afternoon refreshments, awaiting the captain's report.\n\n'I infiltrated the cove last night, braving waves and corrupting music. Dragging myself along the rocks, I saw it-... saw a monstrous, vile merfolk charming a witless woman. When I confronted it, the creature bit me and knocked me out. After I awoke, all that remained was a trail leading inland. I was outplayed once, but I intend to see it skewered for its crimes, general.'\n\nThe general doesn't question the tale's veracity despite its flaws: why the merfolk did not kill him, why it dragged itself inland rather than out to sea, or why he hid the blunt bruise on the back of his skull. Instead, the general pouts, his displeasure hardened with bureaucratic indifference.\n\n'You've set [merfolk_abduction.GetName] alight with panic over your bungle on that beach. The people are practically tearing up their own beds to find it, and it's all your fault for raving about it for...pride? Recognition? It's like you're asking to be washed away with the tide.\n\n'But sir, I've always been a stalwart soldier. Never have I failed before now, so I ask-'\n\n'We do not tolerate failure, past service be damned. Find the merfolk...or it's your head."
 merfolk_events.31.a:0 "Ceaseless search parties should suffice"
 merfolk_events.31.b:0 "Demand answers from the local merfolk!"
 merfolk_events.32.t:0 "The Search Concludes"
 merfolk_events.32.d.1:0 "Day in and day out, foot patrols stomp through [merfolk_abduction.GetName], scouring every alley, nook, and fish bowl for signs of the merfolk and the missing citizen. The unfocused searches only stoke paranoia and invite strife, but by chance, a unit recently noticed a fresh break-in at a condemned ocean-side cistern."
 merfolk_events.32.d.2:0 "A mostly forgotten structure, the subterranean site was barred by wood and stone barriers to prevent trespassers...until today.\n\nA foreboding scene greets the arriving guards: the cistern's seals peeled away, grooves in the dirt hinting at a struggle, and droplets of blood trailing inside. Pressing into the structure's antechamber, the guards discover the missing citizen wounded and prone. Tugging on the first guard to reach her, she gestures further inside, trying her best to communicate via wordless sobs and trembling hand gestures. One of the guards notes the rudimentary signals as a sign language, but can only make out singular words:\n\n'Help. Hurting. Fish. Man. Hurting. Fish. Help. Fish.'\n\nThe patrol doubts their comprehension of the woman's soundless words, but before clarifying her message, a primordial shout seizes the guards' hearts, compelling action.\n\nRushing into the main chamber, the patrol catches two figures contesting a weapon caught between them. A merfolk, covered in bleeding wounds, tussles with none other than the local guard captain. In the chamber's deep shadows, the lengthy merfolk coils like a serpent, struggling to gain traction on the slick floor. The merfolk's eyes flicker between his attacker and the new arrivals, his dark irises swelling with desperation and uncertainty. He utters a string of merfolk words (indecipherable by present company), but the tone is undeniable: a plea.\n\nThe guard captain shoves the merfolk onto his back and screams like a nightmare, fitting the weapon into his bleeding grasp:\n\n'I'LL KILL YOU MYSELF IF YOU DON'T RUN THIS FREAK THROUGH!'"
 merfolk_events.32.a:0 "Assist the bloodied merfolk, as the missing citizen requested"
 merfolk_events.32.b:0 "Aid the raving captain against this obvious monster"
 merfolk_events.33.t:0 "The Ocean's Curve"
 merfolk_events.33.d:0 "The guards hesitate. His rage boiling over, the guard captain screams and charges. The guards attempt to handle the captain with flat blades and blunt pommels, but the consumed man rails through the unit, his strength amplified by venomous rage. The captain knocks one of the guards onto their back before raising his weapon high. In the shadows, he appears like a demon laboring to bring death. And then...he seizes. \n\nBlood pools over his shoulders as the merfolk, snaking behind him, manages to slash at the captain's neck. The captain sways, eyes wide before tumbling dead into the dirty cistern waters. Heaving, the guard recoils as his fellow sentries gather around the merfolk, weapons pointed. The biggest threat dealt with, the merfolk slinks into a pile, heaving and wounded.\n\nFootsteps splash along the cistern's shallow waters as the missing citizen limps inside, falling atop the merfolk and kissing him passionately. The two embrace, earning a moment of love and quiet between them. As the terror that grips [merfolk_abduction.GetName] fades into history, the tale of the mysterious cove earns a glimmer of truth.\n\nA merfolk and surface pair, so taken with the shore, found each other in a secret place. Despite hatred's fire and suspicion's deadly fever, they preserved, escaping those who would see their union as a threat to some precarious order.\n\nBut love, at least this once, won. The monster lay dead, the people reel from their actions over the last months, the merfolk become more than the other, and the cove gently thrums with music and fire just as it did. But rather than a ghostly unease, the calm nights flicker with wonder and hope. For along the shores of that inlet did the ocean find its curve."
 merfolk_events.33.a:0 "The monster is dead"
 merfolk_events.34.t:0 "Love Lost"
 merfolk_events.34.d:0 "The guards nod, rushing in to corner the merfolk. His rage boiling over, the guard captain screams and charges. The guards barely manage to hem in the merfolk's position before the captain descends onto his victim, striking again and again. By the time the captain tires from his assault, the cistern's murky waters flow red as wine. Chucking his weapon aside, the captain inhales sharply, nodding and thanking the men for their service.\n\nFootsteps splash along the cistern's shallow waters as the missing citizen limps inside, falling atop the merfolk and sobbing. She clutches him, but his lifeless body sits silent, unable to embrace her ever again. As the terror that grips [merfolk_abduction.GetName] fades into history, the tale of the mysterious cove warps into a sickly lie.\n\nA vile merfolk, wicked to its core, abducted a woman foolish enough to wander from her home. To right this wrong, a valiant guard captain heroically chased the creature into its lair before slaying it. The people responded with natural and measured actions - actions never to be questioned or examined.\n\nAnd so 'justice' won. The 'monster' lay dead, the people mull about absent introspection, the merfolk remain forever a monstrous other, and [merfolk_abduction.GetName] attracts a stream of hotshots and egotists hoping to earn bloody glory. For along the shores of that inlet did love lose."
 merfolk_events.34.a:0 "The 'monster' is dead"

 merfolk_events.35.d:0 "Bells chime, heralds tout, musicians play, and choruses hum, announcing a seafoam tide magically gliding through [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]'s entry hall. Within the swirling water, merfolk diplomats, fresh from the sea, praise our hospitable welcome, sharing this or that development about their submerged nation. Proud and gentile, the envoys speak amicably of their mission, their journey ashore, and current events with a soft smile or disarming quip - what model guests.\n\nYet a whisper breaks out from among our counselors. Mage and water planetouched advisors note how taxing such a briny display is: Lifting a small pond to swim about in without fear of drying out is one thing, but to do so without rest for hours on end? They surely require respite. After a lone politician blunders into the subject, the merfolk delegation explains genially:\n\n“Our wards can keep us mobile and refreshed. It is but a small effort for our people's future cooperation."\n\nHow can $COUNTRY$ deepen relations with the merfolk if they struggle to survive amid our realm? Yes, the delegation stated it is of no consequence, but is that truth or timid politeness? As hosts, we must oblige our guests by providing palatable refreshments and comfortable environs, but we could also go above and beyond, renovating the capital with grand pools for merfolk habitation and stationing aquamancers with the delegation to maintain their wards, albeit at a great cost. That is, of course, if no one blusters into making a faux pax of the whole merfolk bubble situation. What should we do?"
 merfolk_events.35.a:0 "Spare no expense for their stay with us"

Freshly returned from the merfolk lands beneath the waves, they relay their mission's success.\n\n'Where to begin,' the head diplomat ponders, 'ah, the journey: Uneventful. From the shore, the merfolk greeting party, awash in pearly opulence, wove a spell upon us, adjoining our own abjurations. They then guided us into the heart of their watery nation, showcasing awesome reefs, dark depths, and gargantuan settlements brimming with merfolk. They granted us an audience with their grand councils, esteemed royals, and leading politicians, and while lodging in their seastone palaces, they ensured comforting amenities: dry and airy chambers, savory meals fusing sea and surface cuisine, and even a spell to enhance our swimming. All in all, it was a wholly successful exchange of pomp and circumstance.\n\n'Yet,' the diplomat slows, choosing his next words carefully, 'myself and several other envoys experienced...curious scenarios. At least one of their mercantile royals remarked on our plain attire, an ancient merfolk general toasted to our 'finless' forms, and a host of other odd remarks. Naturally,' the diplomat qualifies, 'we were more than gracious in the face of such comments. We attributed this to jovial jeers meant to deepen bonds - like siblings!'\n\nThe capital court mutters. The merfolk accepted our diplomats, catered them with peerless respect, and returned them whole and hearty to the shore. And yet...the words and remarks seem wholly disrespectful to our senses. How should we react to these apparent offenses?"
