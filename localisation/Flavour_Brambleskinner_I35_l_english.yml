 brambleskinner_clear_the_forest_desc:0 "We need more space for our populations and our growing needs.

 flavor_brambleskinner.2.t:0 "Crush the Slaughterer"

 flavor_brambleskinner.2.b:0 "They will take the lead. To war!"
 flavor_brambleskinner.2.c:0 "The cowards refused!"

 flavor_brambleskinner.3.t:0 "A Durable Arrangement"
 flavor_brambleskinner.3.d:0 "Relgakk Blackmoon is no more, and the Spiked Log clan is safe. For now. It would be in their best interest to accept our rule, to protect them from the other threats that surround them."
 flavor_brambleskinner.3.a:0 "We upheld our part of the arrangement, now it is their turn."

 flavor_brambleskinner.4.t:0 "Brambleskinner demands fealty"

 flavor_brambleskinner.5.a:0 "We will find no peace until the Fey influence is gone from the Woods."

 flavor_brambleskinner.6.t:0 "Distant Cousins"
 flavor_brambleskinner.6.d:0 "We followed the Oubbligband outside the Deepwoods. There, we met other goblins, a bit different from the ones that came with the Greentide, but friendly nevertheless. Maybe should ally them for they would secure our western border."
 flavor_brambleskinner.6.a:0 "New friends, maybe?"

 flavor_brambleskinner.7.t:0 "The Forest and the Sea"
 flavor_brambleskinner.7.d:0 "Ourdia is gone, and Landshark, our trusted ally, is now more secure against their neighbours. As we met with our deal, it is now time for them to comply with it."
 flavor_brambleskinner.7.a:0 "Let them handle the sea shore for our ennemies lie deep within the Woods."

 flavor_brambleskinner.8.t:0 "A Rumor from Bal Ouord"
 flavor_brambleskinner.8.d:0 "With our consolidating grasp on Ourdia, we now have an unprecedented access to the world outside the Deepwoods. From the port of Oudia, we heard a rumor about a magical material called blackpowder. We investigated it for it could be the edge we need against the Fey. We managed to identify its key ingredients - charcoal, sulfur and saltpeter - and we now need to produce more of it."
 flavor_brambleskinner.8.a:0 "Fascinating stuff, it will be a great boon for our country!"

 flavor_brambleskinner.9.t:0 "Firework Celebration"

After the last detonation, silence was covered by panicked screams and the roar of the brazier engulfing what was left of our capital.\n\nNegligence? Reckless behaviour? Fey meddling? We do not know. But one of our biggest blackpowder mills exploded, followed by most of the Blackpowder District. As we try to quell the flames, we barely recognize our capital. The once-proud and powerful [Root.Capital.GetName] now stands in ruins, its streets covered by thousands of carbonized corpses."
 flavor_brambleskinner.10.a:0 "An unexpected setback..."

 flavor_brambleskinner.11.t:0 "The Forest Stirs"
 flavor_brambleskinner.11.d:0 "As we barely contained the fires ravaging our capital, envoys from all over our country come with dark tidings. Many feys are attacking us and seek to lay our whole country to ruin. Perhaps this is retaliation from the blasts that tore our capital appart. Perhaps this is the best opportunity for the trecherous Fey to crush us once and for all. Such considerations will have to wait though, as we now need to fend off this uprising and make sure we live to see another day."
 flavor_brambleskinner.11.a:0 "Curses! To Arms!"
 
 flavor_brambleskinner.12.t:0 "A Successful Front"
 flavor_brambleskinner.12.d:0 "For the first time in centuries, goblins are in charge of the Deepwoods!

 flavor_brambleskinner.12.a:0 "Victorious at last!"

 flavor_brambleskinner.13.t:0 "Fireflower Festival"
 flavor_brambleskinner.13.d:0 "This is a joyous day! Blackpowder and its miracles liberated us from the Fey for good. Our country is more prosperous than ever and we are embracing progress and artificery. Our old clanic structure has made its time, and we shall shed it. Our powerful Cartels now hold much of the power, and we must take example on their flexibility and profitability to start anew.\n\nAs if to embody our success, our artificers outdid themselves and engineered two pyrotechnic marvels, one for war, one for peace. The dreaded Bramble-Burner, part gun, part flamethrower, will instill fear in the hearts of our ennemies, while the fabbled Fireflowers will embellish our night skies. These unique fireworks with intricate shapes and out of this world colors are so popular that we will organize festivals where artificers will compete to make the most beautiful and awe-inspiring displays."
 flavor_brambleskinner.13.a:0 "Hopefully nothing bad will happen this time!"

 artifice_invention_bramble_burners_desc:0 "Bramble-Burners combine two of our most famed weapons : guns and fire. It can shoot bullets in long ranges like regular rifles, but its main feature is the reloadable cartridge bellow the barrel. Filled with specially refined blackpowder, it releases a middle-range flame breath, useful for both carbonizing the ennemy and clearing dense foliage. Despite our best efforts, Bramble-Burners are sometimes unreliable, but even if they rarely malfunction, we always can craft new ones... and find new goblins to use them. Due to its undeserved reputation to be a somewhat-risky weapon, Bramble-Burners are solely used by our most reckless officers and artificer regiments."
